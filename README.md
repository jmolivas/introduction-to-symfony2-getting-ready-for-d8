Introduction to Symfony2: Getting Ready for D8
========================

## Step 1: Install Git

Git is used to checkout and interact with this training repository. You should be able to execute the 'git' command from your command-line interface.

See [GitHub's Setup Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).

## Step 2: Install *AMP Stack

Setup a working AMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack that satisfies these minimum requirements:

* PHP 5.3.3 or higher (PHP 5.4+ recommended)
* A web server: either Apache or the server built into PHP 5.4+.

Several pre-packaged installers are available, as well as compelling virtual machine and cloud-based options. Some of these options are listed here:

### *AMP Installers

* __Multi-platform__: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org), [AMPPS](http://www.ampps.com)
* __OS X__: [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en), [php-osx](http://php-osx.liip.ch)
* __Windows__: [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en)
* __Linux__: _Use your Linux distribution's package manager to install Apache, MySQL, and PHP._

### Nitrous.io

[Nitrous.io](http://nitrous.io) is a cloud-based development environment that offers a __free trial__ which should be sufficient to complete the activities in this training.

### Vagrant

[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) is a cross-platform tool for standardizing and automating the management of virtual machines.

1. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Install Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)
3. Obtain a suitable Vagrant box (_an example is suggested in the following comand_)

        $ git clone -â€“branch master http://git.drupal.org/project/vm.git symfony.dev

4. Adjust virtual machine parameters as needed:

        $ cp parameters.yml.dist parameters.yml

5. Boot the machine

        $ vagrant up

## Step 3: Install Composer

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a tool for managing dependencies for PHP projects.

Follow the [directions](https://getcomposer.org/download/) on the Composer site for installation.

## Step 4: Clone Training Repository

Clone this repo into a subdirectory of your web document root.

    $ git clone https://github.com/jmolivas/introduction-to-symfony2-getting-ready-for-d8.git training

## Step 5: Initialize Symfony

Change into the training directory you created in the previous step, then initialize Symfony with Composer:

    $ cd training
    $ composer install

You will be prompted for several configuration settings. In each case, you may just press enter to accept the default value.

## Step 6: Confirm Your Setup

Symfony includes a script to confirm your setup can run Symfony successfully. You can run this from the command line:

    $ php app/check.php

The output of `check.php` will indicate if there are any errors with your environment and how they may impact your ability to use Symfony.

## Step 7: Run The Development Server

PHP 5.4+ includes a local server that is ideal for local development. To run it, make sure you are in the training directory and execute the following command:

    $ php app/console server:run

If you point your browser at `http://localhost:8000`, you should see a "Welcome!" page generated by Symfony.

__Note:__ _The URL you use may be different if you are using a Virtual Machine (Vagrant) or a cloud-based development environment (Nitrous.io)._

## Step 8: Use the Training Material!

This repository includes branches that correspond with the main phases of the training session. If you wish to skip to a step, you may switch branches with:

    $ git checkout -f <branch>

__Note:__ _The "-f" discards any changes you have made to the code!_
